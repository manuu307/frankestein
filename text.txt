In today’s blog post you are going to learn how to perform face recognition in both images and video streams using:

OpenCV
Python
Deep learning
As we’ll see, the deep learning-based facial embeddings we’ll be using here today are both (1) highly accurate and (2) capable of being executed in real-time.

To learn more about face recognition with OpenCV, Python, and deep learning, just keep reading!

Update July 2021: Added alternative face recognition methods section, including both deep learning-based and non-deep learning-based approaches.

Face recognition with OpenCV, Python, and deep learning
Inside this tutorial, you will learn how to perform facial recognition using OpenCV, Python, and deep learning.

We’ll start with a brief discussion of how deep learning-based facial recognition works, including the concept of “deep metric learning.”

From there, I will help you install the libraries you need to actually perform face recognition.

Finally, we’ll implement face recognition for both still images and video streams.

As we’ll discover, our face recognition implementation will be capable of running in real-time.
